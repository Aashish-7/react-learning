# React Learning Path - Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- **Node.js** installed (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Step 1: Set Up Your First React Project

We'll use **Vite** (modern, fast React setup tool) instead of Create React App.

### Installation Commands

```bash
# Create a new React project
npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react

# Navigate to the project
cd my-first-react-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:5173`
